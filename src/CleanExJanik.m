  % Filter the EEG data before any other processing. The filter can be
  % a low-pass, high-pass or combination of both as well as a custom
  % filter specified with weights.
  % Low-Pass-Filter:
  %  - If left empty, no low-pass will be applied.
  %  - If a single frequency is specified, this applies to all channels.
  %    A frequency of 0.0 means no filter for this channel.
  %  - If a vector of frequencies is specified, every number corresponds
  %    to a channel.

  % frequency, the sharp edge of this filter will introduce ringing.
  % Consider using PreFilterGaussHPFrequency below.
  %E.PreFilterHPFrequency = 1;
  % The filter is implemented in frequency domain, i.e. multiplication of
  % its transfer function. The transfer function is specified as a
  % piecewise linear function with frequency and amplitude points, as
  % also used for functions like firls().
  %  - If left empty, the values are calculated from PreFilterLPFrequency
  %    and PreFilterHPFrequency.
  %  - If set to two single-row vectors, they specify the transfer
  %    function for all channels.
  %  - If set to a cell array, each cell gives the transfer function
  %    points for the corresponding channel.
  %E.PreFilterHFrequencies = [];
  %E.PreFilterHAmplitudes  = [];

  % for the method descriptions as they have some mutual dependencies.
  %
  % Additionally you can specify function handles. These must accept

  %   Type of trigger event to use for artifact synchronization. All

  %   unset, all events are used.
  %   To get a list of all event types try
  %     unique({EEG.event.type})
  % TriggerOffset
  %   Offset of trigger times. The value of this variable is added to the
  %   values taken from EEG.event.latency. If the trigger events from the
  %   original data set are too late, you have to put a negative number
  %   here.

  %
  % Use this methods if some triggers during the acquisition are missing.
  %
  % Important: This function can only find triggers which are between the
  % first and the last triggers as denoted by EEG.event. It doesn't add
  % triggers before the first and after the last.
  %
  % Volumes
  %   Total number of fMRI volumes withing EEG.event.
  % Slices
  %   fMRI slices per volume. Set to 1 if FindTriggers was used for
  %   volume triggers.

  % ADDTRIGGERS  Add triggers outside of defined trigger range
  %

  % are missing.

  % Where
  %   Sample indices into EEG.data to add to the trigger array.
  %E.AddTriggers(...);   % not necessary here

  % GENERATESLICETRIGGERS  Convert volume triggers to slice triggers
  %
  % This function should be called after all volume triggers are setup
  % using the functions FindTriggers(), FindMissingTriggers() and
  % AddTriggers().
  %
  % All internally stored trigger indices are replaced by the newly
  % generated slice trigger indices.
  %
  % Slices
  %   Number of slices per volume, must be integer.
  % Duration
  %   Slice duration in sampling units, can be float.
  % RelPos
  %   Relative position of the first slice trigger of each volume to the
  %   volume trigger. 0.0 means that the first slice trigger is at the
  %   position of the volume trigger, 1.0 means the first slice trigger
  %   is one slice-periode before the volume trigger and the second
  %   slice trigger is at the volume trigger. 0.5 means that the first
  %   and the second volume trigger are centered around the volume
  %   trigger.

% Was macht van der Meer anders?
%  + 30Hz HP 24dB/Oct., "low-frequency EMG signal contents can be regained y rectification"
%  - slice-marker insertion (because their scanner only gives volume markers)
%  - use channel with largest artifact to determine slice-markers, assume identical timing information for other channels
%  - slice vs. volume
%  - optimize timing parameters for slice duration and inter-volume-delay
%  + sub-sample-alignment
%  - replace inter-volume-stuff with synthesized data, note: the volume artifact overlaps a bit with the slices before and after it!
%  + large sliding window (50) and use only (12) best slice-artifacts
%  + PCA: (max?) 4 (Niazy angeblich 4-8):
